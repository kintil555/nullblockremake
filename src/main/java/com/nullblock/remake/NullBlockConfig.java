/**
 * Common config for NullBlock Remake.
 *
 * showInCreativeMenu:
 *   When true (default), the Null Block item shows up in the Building Blocks
 *   creative tab, same as any normal block.
 *
 *   When false, the item is still fully registered (so ItemStacks, saves,
 *   and other mods' references to ModBlocks.NULL_BLOCK / NULL_BLOCK_ITEM keep
 *   working exactly the same), it is just excluded from the creative menu
 *   listing. This is meant for the case where another mod depends on
 *   NullBlockRemakeMod purely as a library — e.g. calling
 *   {@link com.nullblock.remake.api.NullBlockAPI#makePassable} to silently
 *   swap out surface blocks (like grass) for a disguised null block — and
 *   does not want players to be able to obtain/place raw null blocks by hand
 *   from the creative inventory.
